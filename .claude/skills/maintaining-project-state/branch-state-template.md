# Branch State Template

Copy to `docs/project-state/branch-states/<slug>.md`, where `<slug>` is the branch name with `/`
replaced by `-`. Create `docs/project-state/branch-states/archive/` once per project.

A branch state is a **lean "what has changed" file**. It mirrors `PROJECT_STATE.md` section for
section, but each section holds only what **this branch adds or changes**. **Keep every
heading, in the same order and with the same names as `PROJECT_STATE.md`. A section with nothing to
change says `No change.` and, for Architecture, Conventions and Known Gaps, one line saying why** (for
example "No change: this branch only edits docs"). An empty heading is never left blank and never
deleted. `sync-project-state` reads it to update `PROJECT_STATE.md` after merge, so write each section
as the text that should land there, and it can tell "nothing to fold" from "forgot to write it".

Rules that differ from `PROJECT_STATE.md`:

- **Provisional IDs.** IDs you mint carry `~`: `W~1`, `C~2`, `D~1`, `Q~1`. They are unique only in
  this file and are renumbered at fold. Cite existing permanent IDs (`C14`) freely. **Never cite a
  provisional ID outside this file** — commit messages and code comments are not rewritten.
- **Session IDs** (`S1`, `S2`) are local to this file, never folded, and carry no marker.
- **Entries that edit something already in `PROJECT_STATE.md`** (an area's *Now*, a Workstream row,
  a Convention, a Known Gap) name the entry they replace, by ID or area name. Pure additions need
  no such reference.
- Only the project owner fills `Approved`. Agents never do.

# Branch State — <branch>

**What this branch has changed, and how to pick it up.** `PROJECT_STATE.md` describes `INT`;
read it for context and write here instead of editing it. `sync-project-state` folds this file in
after the branch merges.

- **Branch:** <branch> (from `INT` at `<sha>`)
- **Base:** <sha of the `INT` commit last merged into this branch — move it when you merge `INT`>
- **Owner:** <name>
- **Status:** Draft   (`Draft` · `In review` · `Approved` · `Folded`)
- **Approved:** — (project owner only: <name> YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD by <model / agent> — <what changed, five words>

---

**Scope.** <One or two sentences: what this branch is for and which workstream it serves.>

---

## 1. Orientation

Rows added or changed in `PROJECT_STATE.md` § Orientation (new directories, moved paths, new docs), written
as the rows that should land there. Otherwise: `No change.`

---

## 2. How to Resume

**Setup**, only if it differs from `PROJECT_STATE.md` § How to Resume:

```bash
<commands that reach a working state on this branch>
```

**Sessions** — one row per operator-initiated session, however many agents or subagents it runs.
Delete a row once its work is recorded in § Workstreams and § Changes. The table must be empty
before the branch can be approved.

| Session | Started | Agent(s) | Workstream | Status | Doing | Next action | Last touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S2 | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | <model/agent> (lead) + <subagents> | W~1 | Active | Task 6/9: conflict engine | <file, task, and how you know it is done> | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM |
| S1 | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | <model/agent> | W~1 | Blocked — needs human | Q~1 | <what to do once the answer arrives> | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM |

Session status: `Active` · `Paused` · `Blocked — needs human` (name the question).

- **Doing** is a position, like the Progress cell: where in the plan, and an ID.
- **Next action** is concrete enough that a cold agent can start without asking: the file, the
  task, and how it will know it is done.

**Remaining** — work no session has claimed, in order. Mark a follow-up that should **outlive this
branch** with **Handover**; sync copies those into `PROJECT_STATE.md` § How to Resume → Upcoming.
Everything else must be done or removed before approval.

- [ ] <unclaimed task>
- [ ] **Handover:** <follow-up for after the merge, with enough context to act on>

## 3. Workstreams

Rows created or changed on this branch, in `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s columns. An existing workstream
keeps its permanent ID; a new one is `W~n`. A workstream's Guide cell is `—` here (or `N/A` with
the reason); the guide is never edited on a branch.

| ID | Workstream | Status | Spec | Plan | Progress | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W~1 | <name> | Building | [spec](docs/superpowers/specs/....md) | [plan](docs/superpowers/plans/....md) | Task 6/9 in flight: conflict engine | — |

---

## 4. Architecture

One block per area this branch changes, named exactly as in `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Write the text that
should replace the area's **Now**, not a description of the change. If no area changes, write
`No change: <one-line reason>`.

### 4.x <Area name>

**Now (proposed):** <what the area is and how it behaves once this branch lands — the full
replacement paragraph, naming real files and functions.>

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `<file>` | <what it owns> |

| ID | Date | Decision | Why / who asked | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C~1 | YYYY-MM-DD | <decision that shaped this area> | <rationale; what was rejected> | [spec §3](...) |

---

## 5. Conventions

Entries added, changed (name the entry replaced) or removed, in `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s format. Otherwise:
`No change: <one-line reason>`.

---

## 6. Known Gaps

Entries added, changed or removed. Otherwise: `No change: <one-line reason>`.

---

## 7. Needs a Human

Questions added or resolved. Otherwise: `No change.`

---

## 8. Decisions

Decisions added or changed, with provisional IDs. Otherwise: `No change.`

---

## 9. Deviations

Deviations and discoveries added, with provisional IDs. Otherwise: `No change.`

---

## 10. Changes

One line per change on this branch, big or small: what changed and why, with a commit as the
reference. Copied into the Done ledger at fold. Not a copy of `git log`.

| Date | What changed | Workstream | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | <outcome, user-visible where possible> | W~1 | `<sha>` |
